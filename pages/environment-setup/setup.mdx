# Setting up the development environment
This page will help you install and build your first React Native app.

**If you are new to mobile development**, the easiest way to get started is with Expo Go. Expo is a set of tools and services built around React Native and, while it has many features, the most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get you writing a React Native app within minutes. You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator. If you'd like to try out React Native directly in your web browser before installing any tools, you can try out Snack.

**If you are already familiar with mobile development**, you may want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Tabs items={['Expo Go Quickstart', 'React Native CLI Quickstart']}>
  <Tab>
    Run the following command to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
   Follow these instructions if you need to build native code in your project. For example, if you are integrating React Native into an existing application, or if you ran "prebuild" from Expo to generate your project's native code, you'll need this section.

   The instructions are a bit different depending on your development operating system, and whether you want to start developing for iOS or Android. If you want to develop for both Android and iOS, that's fine - you can pick one to start with, since the setup is a bit different.

## Installing dependencies
You will need Node, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, and Android Studio.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Android Studio in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for Android.

### Node
Follow the installation instructions for your Linux distribution to install Node 14 or newer.

### Java Development Kit
React Native currently recommends version 11 of the Java SE Development Kit (JDK). You may encounter problems using higher JDK versions. You may download and install OpenJDK from AdoptOpenJDK or your system packager.

### Android development environment
Setting up your development environment can be somewhat tedious if you're new to Android development. If you're already familiar with Android development, there are a few things you may need to configure. In either case, please make sure to carefully follow the next few steps.

#### 1. Install Android Studio
Download and install Android Studio. While on Android Studio installation wizard, make sure the boxes next to all of the following items are checked:

- Android SDK
- Android SDK Platform
- Android Virtual Device

Then, click "Next" to install all of these components.

import tlstyles from '../../components/callout.module.css'

export function Callout({content}) {      
    return (
      <div className={tlstyles.tooltip}>        
        {content}
      </div>
    )
}

<Callout content={"If the checkboxes are grayed out, you will have a chance to install these components later on."}/>

Once setup has finalized and you're presented with the Welcome screen, proceed to the next step.
