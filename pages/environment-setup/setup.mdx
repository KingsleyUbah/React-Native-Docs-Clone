# Setting up the development environment
This page will help you install and build your first React Native app.

**If you are new to mobile development**, the easiest way to get started is with Expo Go. Expo is a set of tools and services built around React Native and, while it has many features, the most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get you writing a React Native app within minutes. You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator. If you'd like to try out React Native directly in your web browser before installing any tools, you can try out Snack.

**If you are already familiar with mobile development**, you may want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.

    Run the following command to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

    <Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn']}>
      <Tab>
        ```bash
        npx create-expo-app AwesomeProject

        cd AwesomeProject
        npx expo start
        ```        
      </Tab>
      <Tab>
        ```bash
        yarn create expo-app AwesomeProject

        cd AwesomeProject
        yarn expo start
        ```    
      </Tab>  
    </Tabs>

    This will start a development server for you.

    ## Running your React Native application
    Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the default iOS Camera app.

    ### Modifying your app
    Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it. Open App.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines. The application should reload automatically once you save your changes.

    ### That's it!
    Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your first React Native app.


    ## Now what?
    Expo also has docs you can reference if you have questions specific to the tool. You can also ask for help on the Expo Discord.

    If you have a problem with Expo, before creating a new issue, please see if there's an existing issue about it in the Expo issues.

    If you're curious to learn more about React Native, check out the Introduction to React Native.

    
    ### Running your app on a simulator or virtual device
    Expo Go allows you to run your React Native app on a physical device without installing iOS and Android native SDKs. If you want to run your app on the iOS Simulator or an Android Virtual Device, please refer to the instructions for "React Native CLI Quickstart" to learn how to install Xcode or set up your Android development environment.

    Once you've set these up, you can launch your app on an Android Virtual Device by running npm run android, or on the iOS Simulator by running npm run ios (macOS only).

    ### Caveats
    The Expo Go app is a great tool to get started — it exists to help developers quickly get projects off the ground, to experiment with ideas (such as on Snack) and share their work with minimal friction. Expo Go makes this possible by including a feature-rich native runtime made up of every module in the Expo SDK, so all you need to do to use a module is install the package with npx expo install and reload your app.

    The tradeoff is that the Expo Go app does not allow you to add custom native code — you can only use native modules built into the Expo SDK. There are many great libraries available outside of the Expo SDK, and you may even want to build your own native library. You can leverage these libraries with development builds, or by using "prebuild" to generate the native projects, or both. Learn more about adding native code to projects created with create-expo-app.

    create-expo-app configures your project to use the most recent React Native version that is supported by the Expo SDK. The Expo Go app usually gains support for a given React Native version with new SDK versions (released quarterly). You can check this document to find out what versions are supported.

    If you're integrating React Native into an existing project, you can use the Expo SDK and development builds, but you will need to set up a native development environment. Select "React Native CLI Quickstart" above for instructions on configuring a native build environment for React Native.

   Follow these instructions if you need to build native code in your project. For example, if you are integrating React Native into an existing application, or if you ran "prebuild" from Expo to generate your project's native code, you'll need this section.

   The instructions are a bit different depending on your development operating system, and whether you want to start developing for iOS or Android. If you want to develop for both Android and iOS, that's fine - you can pick one to start with, since the setup is a bit different.

   ## Installing dependencies
    You will need Node, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, and Android Studio.

    While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Android Studio in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for Android.

    ### Node
    Follow the installation instructions for your Linux distribution to install Node 14 or newer.

    ### Java Development Kit
    React Native currently recommends version 11 of the Java SE Development Kit (JDK). You may encounter problems using higher JDK versions. You may download and install OpenJDK from AdoptOpenJDK or your system packager.

    ### Android development environment
    Setting up your development environment can be somewhat tedious if you're new to Android development. If you're already familiar with Android development, there are a few things you may need to configure. In either case, please make sure to carefully follow the next few steps.

    #### 1. Install Android Studio
    Download and install Android Studio. While on Android Studio installation wizard, make sure the boxes next to all of the following items are checked:

    - Android SDK
    - Android SDK Platform
    - Android Virtual Device

    Then, click "Next" to install all of these components.

    If the checkboxes are grayed out, you will have a chance to install these components later on.

    Once setup has finalized and you're presented with the Welcome screen, proceed to the next step.

    #### 2. Install the Android SDK
    Android Studio installs the latest Android SDK by default. Building a React Native app with native code, however, requires the Android 13 (Tiramisu) SDK in particular. Additional Android SDKs can be installed through the SDK Manager in Android Studio.

    To do that, open Android Studio, click on "Configure" button and select "SDK Manager".

    The SDK Manager can also be found within the Android Studio "Preferences" dialog, under Appearance & Behavior → System Settings → Android SDK.

    Select the "SDK Platforms" tab from within the SDK Manager, then check the box next to "Show Package Details" in the bottom right corner. Look for and expand the Android 13 (Tiramisu) entry, then make sure the following items are checked:

    - Android SDK Platform 33
    - Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image or Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image
    
    Next, select the "SDK Tools" tab and check the box next to "Show Package Details" here as well. Look for and expand the "Android SDK Build-Tools" entry, then make sure that 33.0.0 is selected.

    Finally, click "Apply" to download and install the Android SDK and related build tools.
